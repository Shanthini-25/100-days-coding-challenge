No play and eating all day makes your belly fat. This happened to Manish during the lockdown. His weight before the lockdown was w1 kg (measured on the most accurate hospital machine) and after M months of lockdown, when he measured his weight at home (on a regular scale, which can be inaccurate), he got the result that his weight was w2 kg (w2>w1).
Scientific research in all growing kids shows that their weights increase by a value between x1 and x2 kg (inclusive) per month, but not necessarily the same value each month. Manish assumes that he is a growing kid. Tell him whether his home scale could be giving correct results.

Amit and Feedback
Lots of geeky customers visit our Amit's restaurant everyday. So, when asked to fill the feedback form, these customers represent the feedback using a binary string (i.e a string that contains only characters '0' and '1'.
Now since Amit is not that great in deciphering binary strings, he has decided the following criteria to classify the feedback as Good or Bad :
If the string contains the substring "010" or "101", then the feedback is Good, else it is Bad. Note that, to be Good it is not necessary to have both of them as substring.
So given some binary strings, you need to output whether according to the Amit, the strings are Good or Bad.
Input
The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of feedbacks. Each of the next T lines contains a string composed of only '0' and '1'.
Output
For every test case, print in a single line Good or Bad as per the Amit's method of classification.

New Tablet
Ajinkya decided to buy a new tablet. His budget is B, so he cannot buy a tablet whose price is greater than B. Other than that, he only has one criterion — the area of the tablet's screen should be as large as possible. Of course, the screen of a tablet is always a rectangle.
Ajinkya has visited some tablet shops and listed all of his options. In total, there are N available tablets, numbered 1 through N. For each valid i, the i-th tablet has width Wi, height Hi and price Pi.
Help Ajinkya choose a tablet which he should buy and find the area of such a tablet's screen, or determine that he cannot buy any tablet.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and B. N lines follow.
For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers Wi, Hi and Pi.
Output
For each test case, print a single line. If Ajinkya cannot buy any tablet, it should contain the string "no tablet" (without quotes).
Otherwise, it should contain a single integer — the maximum area of the screen of a tablet Ajinkya can buy.

Suppose, we have a class A which is the base class and we have a class B which is derived from class A and we have a class C which is derived from class B, we can access the functions of both class A and class B by creating an object for class C.
Hence, this mechanism is called multi-level inheritance. (B inherits A and C inherits B.)

In this problem you will have to implement a simple editor. The editor maintains the content of a string S and have two following functions:
"+ i x": insert a string x into the current string S after the i'th character of the S (we use 1-indexing in this problem). When i equals to 0 it mean we add x at the beginning of S.
"? i len": Print the sub-string of length len starting at position i'th of S.
At the beginning, the editor holds an empty string. There will be Q queries of the two types described above.
Input
The first line contains the integer Q. Each line in the next Q lines contains one query.
Output
For each query of the second type, print out the answer sub-string in one line.

A string is called boring if all the characters of the string are same.
You are given a string S of length N, consisting of lowercase english alphabets. Find the length of the longest boring substring of S which occurs more than once.
Note that if there is no boring substring which occurs more than once in S, the answer will be 00.
A substring is obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) elements from the beginning of the string and some (possibly zero) elements from the end of the string.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N, denoting the length of string S.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the length of the longest boring substring of S which occurs more than once.

You are a person who is always fond of eating candies. Your friend gave you a candy of length N, to eat during the break period of your school.
You start eating this candy from one of the ends. But as it is not your candy, your friend told you to eat exactly K unit length of candy during each bite. You will stop eating if the candy's length becomes 00. This means that you have eaten the entire candy.
If at some point of time, the candy's length is positive, but less than K, you cannot take a bite thereafter.
Can you eat the complete candy? If yes, print the number bites it will take, else print −1−1.
Input Format
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of two spaced integers N, K.
Output Format
For each testcase, print the minimum number of bites you need to eat the complete candy. Print −1−1 if it is not possible to do so.

You are given a binary string S of length N. You can perform the following operation on S:
Pick any set of indices such that no two picked indices are adjacent.
Flip the values at the picked indices (i.e. change 0 to 1 and 1 to 0).
For example, consider the string S=1101101.
If we pick the indices {1,3,6}, then after flipping the values at picked indices, we will get 1?10?110?1→0111111.
Note that we cannot pick the set {2,3,5} since 2 and 3 are adjacent indices.
Find the minimum number of operations required to convert all the characters of S to 0.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the length of the binary string S.
