Balancing Weight
No play and eating all day makes your belly fat. This happened to Manish during the lockdown. His weight before the lockdown was w1 kg (measured on the most accurate hospital machine) and after M months of lockdown, when he measured his weight at home (on a regular scale, which can be inaccurate), he got the result that his weight was w2 kg (w2>w1).
Scientific research in all growing kids shows that their weights increase by a value between x1 and x2 kg (inclusive) per month, but not necessarily the same value each month. Manish assumes that he is a growing kid. Tell him whether his home scale could be giving correct results.

Amit and Feedback
Lots of geeky customers visit our Amit's restaurant everyday. So, when asked to fill the feedback form, these customers represent the feedback using a binary string (i.e a string that contains only characters '0' and '1'.
Now since Amit is not that great in deciphering binary strings, he has decided the following criteria to classify the feedback as Good or Bad :
If the string contains the substring "010" or "101", then the feedback is Good, else it is Bad. Note that, to be Good it is not necessary to have both of them as substring.
So given some binary strings, you need to output whether according to the Amit, the strings are Good or Bad.
Input
The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of feedbacks. Each of the next T lines contains a string composed of only '0' and '1'.
Output
For every test case, print in a single line Good or Bad as per the Amit's method of classification.

New Tablet
Ajinkya decided to buy a new tablet. His budget is B, so he cannot buy a tablet whose price is greater than B. Other than that, he only has one criterion — the area of the tablet's screen should be as large as possible. Of course, the screen of a tablet is always a rectangle.
Ajinkya has visited some tablet shops and listed all of his options. In total, there are N available tablets, numbered 1 through N. For each valid i, the i-th tablet has width Wi, height Hi and price Pi.
Help Ajinkya choose a tablet which he should buy and find the area of such a tablet's screen, or determine that he cannot buy any tablet.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and B. N lines follow.
For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers Wi, Hi and Pi.
Output
For each test case, print a single line. If Ajinkya cannot buy any tablet, it should contain the string "no tablet" (without quotes).
Otherwise, it should contain a single integer — the maximum area of the screen of a tablet Ajinkya can buy.
